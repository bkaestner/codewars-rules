# About these documents

These documents contains some rules I've employed for my katas and my
translations on [Codewars]. Some of them are very simple
(e.g same arguments, same order), others are sometimes really hard to fulfill
(random tests). But only rules aren't interesting. This document contains also
some tips, so that you (or I) can implement them.

All documents are written in Markdown so that you can easily view them on GitHub
(see the rules directory).

If you find an error, have a better idea, or think that all of this is a pile of
unicorn misery, feel free to create an issue or a pull-request. Have a look at
the LICENCE before contributing (it's CC-BY-SA 4.0).

# Getting a PDF

Clone the repository and use `make`. You need to install a recent version
of [pandoc]. However, since I'm using Travis to check that this really works,
I'm also releasing an automatically generated PDF from time to time, check the
releases.
